# Modules

## User retrieval
Using [jsonplaceholder users API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), all Users must be retrieved and setting up onto a class.

## User operations

Each user must have several private and public methods to operate with each User's property. For every User you should be able to:
- Move out to another address
- Update contact information (email, phone and website)
- Hire and fire from a company


## Filtering

For the whole set of users, filters should be set such that subsets of users that can be retrieved:

 - Their surname begins with the letter M
 - The company they work for is involved in something application related
 - Search by location and show the 2 closest users.
