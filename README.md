# Capstone project

The project consists of a very basic application that makes use of the API provided by [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) (see [Project](https://github.com/LdeBerried/how-to-python/blob/main/project/README.md)) in order to work with the Python language and a series of programming concepts.

# Coding concepts

## Python Basics
Learn the basics of Python syntax and how to use it.
Pythonic way of coding.
